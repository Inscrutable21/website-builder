            <h2>Dynamic Layout Optimization with Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms</h2>
            <p>Reinforcement learning models, such as Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms, can dynamically optimize page layouts based on user engagement metrics. These models experiment with different variations of several key elements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Content Positioning</li>
                <li>Call-to-Action Placement</li>
                <li>Visual Hierarchies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By testing these variations, the system identifies the configurations that yield the best results for different user segments.</p>

            <h2>Continuous Optimization with User Experience Safeguards</h2>
            <p>A feedback loop is crucial for continuous improvement. The system constantly measures the performance of different layout variations and gradually adjusts towards more effective arrangements.</p>
            <p>To ensure a positive user experience, safeguards are implemented to prevent abrupt layout changes that could confuse returning users. The system prioritizes gradual optimization, maintaining a degree of consistency while steadily improving performance.</p>
