            <h2>1. Data Collection and Integration</h2>
            <p>Comprehensive tracking of user interactions is crucial for understanding content performance and user preferences. This involves capturing key metrics such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Page views</li>
                <li>Time on page</li>
                <li>Scroll depth</li>
                <li>Click patterns</li>
                <li>Conversion events</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Integration with established analytics platforms like Google Analytics 4 provides a broad overview of website traffic and user behavior. Supplementing this with custom event tracking allows for a deeper understanding of specific content interactions, providing granular insights.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="user-segmentation">
            <h2>2. User Segmentation and Personalization</h2>
            <p>Collected behavioral data is then processed using clustering algorithms, such as K-means or DBSCAN. These algorithms identify distinct user segments based on similar interaction patterns. For example, users who consistently engage with specific types of content or follow particular navigation paths can be grouped together.</p>
            <p>These identified segments form the foundation for personalization rules. By understanding the characteristic behavior of each group, the system can tailor content presentation, recommendations, and other features to better suit individual user preferences, leading to a more engaging and relevant user experience.</p>
