            <h2>Dynamic Layout Optimization with Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms</h2>
            <p>Reinforcement learning models, such as Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms, can dynamically optimize page layouts based on user engagement metrics. These models experiment with various content positioning, call-to-action placement, and visual hierarchy configurations. The goal is to identify the layouts that yield the best results for different user segments.</p>

            <h2>Continuous Feedback and Gradual Optimization</h2>
            <p>A feedback loop is crucial for continuous performance measurement of different layout variations. The system should progressively shift towards more effective arrangements based on this feedback.</p>
            <p>To maintain user experience consistency, safeguards should be implemented to prevent abrupt layout changes that might confuse returning users. The system should favor gradual optimization, allowing for consistent improvements in performance while preserving a familiar interface.</p>
