            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This document outlines the implementation of an automated A/B testing framework designed to optimize content and improve key performance indicators (KPIs). The framework will support both simple A/B tests and more complex multivariate testing scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Framework Capabilities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="capability-title">A/B Testing:</span> Compare two variations of content (A and B) to determine which performs better based on chosen KPIs.</li>
                <li><span class="capability-title">Multivariate Testing:</span> Simultaneously test multiple variations across different page elements, allowing for the identification of optimal combinations.</li>
                <li><span class="capability-title">Bayesian Optimization:</span> Utilize Bayesian optimization techniques to efficiently explore the vast space of potential content variations, focusing testing resources on the most promising candidates.</li>
                <li><span class="capability-title">Statistical Analysis:</span> Integrate statistical analysis tools to assess the significance of test results and determine the appropriate time to make data-driven decisions. This includes determining when sufficient data has been collected for reliable conclusions.</li>

            <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
            <p>The framework will be automated, streamlining the process of running and evaluating A/B and multivariate tests. It will leverage Bayesian optimization to intelligently allocate testing resources, maximizing efficiency and accelerating the discovery of optimal content variations. Robust statistical analysis tools will be incorporated to provide clear insights into test performance and ensure that decisions are based on statistically significant results. The framework will also provide guidance on when additional data is required before drawing conclusions.</p>
